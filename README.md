# Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. Webpage


## Description

For Weekly Challenge 1 of the edX Bootcamp Front End Course, I was given an on-the-job ticket by a marketing agency to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 
I have provided below details of the User Story, Acceptance Criteria, Resources and Assessment Requirements.


> What was my motivation?

My motivation was to accelerate my front end skills in web development so I can successsfully secure a web development job. 


>Why I built this project?

Building the website helped me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical. 


> What problem did it solve?

It addresses the issue of Accessibility, a crucial element in web development. This ensures that individuals with disabilities can navigate a website with the aid of assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Enhancing website accessibility is not only beneficial for users but also advantageous for businesses. Accessible sites tend to rank higher in search engines, such as Google, and contribute to avoiding potential legal issues that may arise when individuals with disabilities encounter barriers in accessing a website.


> What did I learn?

I learnt the skills to refactor a given website that uses both html and CSS from researching the web and also from the course classes.


> What makes my project stand out? 

The project work that I have completed stands out as it follows all the design principles of a good website using industry standards.
